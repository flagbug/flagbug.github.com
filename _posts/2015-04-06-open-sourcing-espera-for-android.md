title: Open Sourcing Espera for Android
comments: true
---

Today I'm open sourcing one of my few closed source projects: [Espera for Android](https://github.com/flagbug/Espera.Mobile)

Espera for Android is the Android remote control for the already open source [Espera media player](https://github.com/flagbug/Espera).

The reason for open sourcing it is simple: It didn't make me any money (read: $0)

There is no point in keeping an application that doesn't have a viable business model closed source, 
so I'm opening it up for public contributions and in the next few days, 
I'm even making the existing premium features free.

Espera for Android is written with Xamarin for Android, Reactive Extensions, ReactiveUI and Akavache, 
so I hope it helps people who want to learn writing apps with these libraries.

Please note that this is my first Xamarin/Android application, 
so it may or may not follow the best practices on the Android platform.
