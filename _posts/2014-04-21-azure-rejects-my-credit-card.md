title: Azure rejects my credit card

Recently, I wanted to give Microsoft Azure a try. 
Since I'm already registered with Amazon AWS and Google Cloud, a registration with Azure should work too, right?

So I registered with my email address and password, entered my credit card information and pressed the register button.

**We can't authorize the payment method. Please make sure the information is correct, or use another payment method. 
If you continue to get this message, please contact your financial institution.**

Wat.

I'm 99.99% sure that I've entered everything correctly and tried it again. Nope, still doesn't work.

After a few days of back and forth with the Azure support, they told me the problem is that my credit card is a Prepaid card.
Since I'm from Austria and really only need my credit card for buying small things on the internet, I don't have a different card.

The support also told me:
> ...the reason why we do not accept the prepaid card is because in past we have seen the subscriptions being disabled due to insufficient funds in the prepaid card.

While I can understand the reasoning behind this, I wonder why AWS and Google Cloud accept my credit card.

Well, seems like no Azure for me.
